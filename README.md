Abstract 

The Nectar Mount Resort has been recognized as a premier hotel in the Rathnapura 
area since 2017. It is situated in a picturesque location, offering stunning views and a serene 
environment. Two reception halls are possessed by them, which are considered perfect 
venues for celebrating various events such as birthday parties, engagements, wedding 
receptions, business Parties, Private Parties, etc. They provide a unique and memorable 
experience for their guests with the most affordable and particularly flexible packages.  

Currently, a manual file-based process is used for their management, which leads to 
various issues throughout the business process. The current system at the hotel requires 
customers to be visited in person for reservations and payments. Manual processes for tasks 
such as payment processing, event scheduling, and customer communication are considered 
inefficient. Effective communication of important information to staff and customers can be 
found to be challenging, leading to confusion and errors. The task of generating reports from 
previous years is also found to be time-consuming.   

To address the limitations of the manual system, a web-based hotel reservation 
system was developed. It was built using PHP as the programming language, following the 
modern waterfall model. MySQL was selected to design the database structure. To improve 
the user experience, various client-side technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
Bootstrap were integrated. XAMPP served as the web server, and NetBeans was the chosen 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Extensive testing was carried out using 
Google Chrome, and the UML diagrams in the dissertation were created with draw.io. 

The client's requirements are intended to be met by the proposed system, and it is 
expected that Nectar Mount Resort's business activities will be enhanced in a more 
productive and well-organized manner. The hotel will be enabled to automate its 
management process, providing efficient handling of bookings and streamlining customer 
service through the implementation of this system. By utilizing this system, the hotel will 
be able to operate more effectively and offer a better experience to its guests.
